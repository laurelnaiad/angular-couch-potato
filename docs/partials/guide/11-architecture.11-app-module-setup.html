<h3 id="stopbreatheandlookatthesamples">Stop, Breathe and Look at the Samples</h4>

<p>Yes, you were called impatient, hasty and quick if you wanted to look at the
samples.  Well it was a joke (perhaps a weak one).  Or maybe it was deemed important
to read the conceptual overview.  In any case, the rest of this
guide <strong>assumes</strong> you've looked at the samples.  Using Couch Potato is actually
pretty easy, and without seeing it in action it may feel more complicated
and confusing than it needs to be or is.</p>

<p>So have a look at the
<a href="https://github.com/stu-salsbury/angular-couch-potato/tree/master/samples" target="_blank">source and its readme</a>
and see them <a href="samples/" target="_blank">in action</a>!</p>

<p>Since Couch Potato component definitions run outside of the Angular context,
there are two things we need to "do to" the app in order to be able to reach
back into it to register components.  Let's take them in order of when they
occur in the lifecycle of the application.</p>

<p>When the application module is declared, we want to define the registerXXX functions that Couch Potato components use.</p>

<p>The easiest and best way is probably to let Couch Potato do it for us. When you
declare your module and its dependencies, ask Couch Potato to configure the
app.</p>

<p>Two examples follow.  The first assumes you've used &lt;script&gt; tags to
load Angular and Couch Potato and the second uses the AMD-style.  It's
important to realize that the choice <em>does not</em> impact the way Couch Potato
components are authored.</p>

<p>Using &lt;script&gt; tags:
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
  var myApp = angular.module('myApp', ['scs.couch-potato']);

  couchPotato.configureApp(myApp);
</pre>

<p>Using AMD:
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
define(['angular','couch-potato'], function(angular, couchPotato) {
  var myApp = angular.module('myApp', ['scs.couch-potato']);

  couchPotato.configureApp(myApp);
});
</pre>

<p>Pretty easy.</p>

<p>So what just happened?  Couch Potato has assigned some functions as variables
on the app.  Specifically:</p>

<ul>
<li>registerController(name, controller)</li>
<li>registerFactory(name, factory)</li>
<li>registerDirective(name, directive)</li>
<li>registerFilter(name, filter)</li>
<li>registerDecorator(name, decorator)</li>
<li>registerValue(name, value)</li>
</ul>

<p>It is these functions that the Couch Potato components call to accomplish
registration.  More on their inner workings below.</p>

<p>The second thing we want to do occurs when the application enters run-time.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
myApp.run(['$couchPotato', function($couchPotato) {
  myApp.lazy = $couchPotato; //note that you need to use the name 'lazy'
});
</pre>

<p>This little assignment gives those register functions that were assigned above
the capability of asking Couch Potato to do its work.  Remember that the RequireJS AMD
modules <em>do not</em> run in an Angular context -- hence we wouldn't be able to use
dependency injection to grab the $couchPotato service.  Latching onto it in
module.run works around this.</p>

<p>So back to those registerXXX functions.  In fact, they contain branches.
Each one looks something like this (we'll use registerController but they're
all doing the same thing).  Keep in mind you don't write these, Couch Potato
assigns them to the app module for you when you call configureApp.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
function registerController(name, controller) {
  if (app.lazy) {
    app.lazy.registerController([name, controller]);
  }
  else {
    app.controller(name, controller);
  }
}
</pre>

<p>Why the branch?  It enables calls to registerController (or registerDirective,
etc.) to function at at configuration time <strong>or</strong> at run time.  This is really
handy.  In practical terms, you can author <em>all</em> of your components as Couch
Potato components, whether you want to compile them into your eventual app.js
using r.js optimization or you want to load/register them lazily.</p>

<h3 id="advancedsetup">Advanced Setup</h4>

<p>What follows assumes you're using RequireJS to load
your app and is relatively advanced.  It is likely to be confusing to those who
do not know RequireJS well.  (If you're using &lt;script&gt; tags then you're probably
compiling certain components directly into your application module anyway.)</p>

<p>You've been warned.  If you want to skip this section you can move straight on
to <a href="#/guide/25-lazy-loading-via-routing">Lazy Loading Via Routing</a>.</p>

<p>The distinction between whether r.js will compile Couch Potato components
 or whether they will be lazy-loaded/registered is effected by whether or not you <code>require</code> (as in
use the RequireJS require function on) them within your RequireJS <code>main.js</code>
file (or wherever it is that you have your RequireJS entry point).  An example is probably necessary to flesh out this concept.</p>

<p>Let's say your (over)simplified main.js looks like this -- relatively normal
RequireJS configuration for an Angular app:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
require.config({
  paths: {
    'angular':            '//somecdn/angular.min.js',
    'angular-ui-router':  '//somecdn/angular-ui-router.min.js',
    'couch-potato':       '/js/angular-couch-potato.min.js'
  }
});

require(['app', 'run'], function(app) {
  angular.element(document).ready(function() {
    angular.bootstrap($('html'), [
      app['name'], function() {
        $('html').addClass('ng-app');
      }
    ]
  });
});
</pre>

<p>'app' is your AMD module that defines the Angular app module.</p>

<p>'run' is your AMD module that causes the Angular app to be run.</p>

<p>This main.js just initializes the app and runs it, then attaches the
bootstrap function to the document ready event.  As said, this is basic
RequireJS/Angular stuff.  Uses jQuery, but that's not important.</p>

<p>Everything in main.js will be compiled by r.js -- <strong>including the components
that are required, and the ones they require, etc.</strong></p>

<p>So anything that 'app' depends on, and anything that 'run' depends on -- those
will be compiled into your output from r.js (if they are not prevented by being
loaded from a CDN or otherwise exluded from the r.js compile process).</p>

<p>Let's look at app.js:
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
define(['angular', 'couch-potato', 'ui-router'],
  function(angular, couchPotato) {
    var app = angular.module('myApp', [
      'ui.state'
      'scs.couch-potato'
    ]);

    couchPotato.configureApp(app);

    // return app so you can access it using RequireJs
    return app;
  }
);
</pre>

<p>Aside from configuring the app for Couch Potato, this is all still normal
RequireJS/Angular.  Don't get bored -- we're getting toward the point here...</p>

<p>Let's look at run.js:
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
define(['app', 'config', 'someService'],
  function(app) {
    app.run(['$couchPotato', 'someService',
      function($couchPotato, someService) {
        app.lazy = $couchPotato;
      }
    ]);
  }
);
</pre>

<p>So this causes the app to go into run mode, and assigns $couchPotato to
app.lazy.  For the present exposition, what matters is that 'config' is
required.</p>

<p>Here's config.js:
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
define(['app', 'couch-potato', 'compiled-components'], function(app) {
  app.config('$couchPotatoProvider', function($couchPotatoProvider) {
    // nothing really needed here except the rest of your app.config logic
  });
});
</pre>

<p>So, because it's necessary, $couchPotatoProvider is injected. But the point
here is that 'compiled-components' is required.  This is the module in which
you specific which of your Couch Potato components will <em>not</em> be lazy loaded,
and instead will be compiled into your app by r.js.</p>

<p>One approach here is to bail on lazy loading filters and decorators.  You may
also have some directives that are used all over the place and not worth
tracking as individual dependencies or lazy loading them.</p>

<p>In which case, 'compiled-components.js' could look like:
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
define(
  [
    'filters',
    'decorators',
    'common-directives'
  ], function() {
});
</pre>

<p>Since all of the modules in this exposition are required down from main.js,
r.js is going to build them into the compiled output.</p>

<p>Components that are not required by this tree of dependencies will be lazy
loaded as disussed in
<a href="#/guide/25-lazy-loading-via-routing">Lazy Loading Via Routing</a>.</p></div>
