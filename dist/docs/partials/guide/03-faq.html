<h5 id="fequently-asked-couch-potato-questions_why-use-couch-potato">Why Use Couch Potato</h5>
<p>Couch Potato is useful if you want to delay a few, some or most of your Angular components for speed or scale reasons.  It allows you to author all components in one framework, and choose through configuration which components are &quot;compiled in&quot; to your application and which ones are lazy loaded, and to have fine-grained control over when that lazy loading takes place.  It can help you organize dependencies for your routes.</p>
<h5 id="fequently-asked-couch-potato-questions_is-couch-potato-a-replacement-for-xyzrouter">Is Couch Potato a replacement for xyzRouter?</h5>
<p>No, Couch Potato isn&#39;t a router.  It&#39;s meant to be used <em>with</em> a router.  It is known to work with with current versions of <a href="https://github.com/angular-ui/ui/router" target="_blank">angular-ui-router</a> (recommended) and Angular&#39;s stock router (and ngRoute). It is built into <a href="https://github.com/afterglowtech/angular-detour" target="_blank">angular-detour</a>.  It <em>should</em> work in any context where promises are resolved.</p>
<p>It can also be used outside the context of routing.</p>
<h5 id="fequently-asked-couch-potato-questions_can-undefine-or-redefine-components">Can undefine or redefine components?</h5>
<p>At this time, you cannot undefine or redefine components at run-time.</p>
<h5 id="fequently-asked-couch-potato-questions_can-i-lazy-depend-on-modules">Can I lazy-depend on modules?</h5>
<p>No.  At least one experiment is known to have established lazy-loading modules to be possible, but it involves hacking Angular.</p>
<p><strong>What does work</strong>: If you have a component that you want to lazy-load and it depends on
a non-Angular-based script library, such as d3 or a jQuery plugin, you can depend on that
library in the Couch Potato context and defer loading it until your component is loaded.</p>
<p><strong>What doesn&#39;t work</strong>: If you have a component that you want to lazy-load and it depends on an Angular-based module, e.g. angular-ui/bootstrap, then your application itself must depend on bootstrap at declaration time.</p>

<h5 id="fequently-asked-couch-potato-questions_run-time-module-loading-is-coming-to-angular----how-is-couch-potato-related">Run-time Module Loading is Coming To Angular -- How is Couch Potato Related?</h5>
<p>It&#39;s not.</p>
<p>For one, Couch Potato doesn&#39;t operate at the module level by design.  Operating at the component level within application components is the intent of Couch Potato.  Module-level dependencies are at a higher-level.</p>
<p>Two, run-time loading of modules isn&#39;t here, yet.  Time will tell whether/how Couch Potato will fit into the future AnguarJS landscape.</p>
<h5 id="fequently-asked-couch-potato-questions_whats-in-the-future">What&#39;s in the future?</h5>
<ul>
<li><p>Couch Potato tests: the project does not have any tests, yet.  It should have tests
before version 1.0.0.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Testing components that are authored as Couch Potato components: guidelines/examples
for testing apps built with Couch Potato.  Will probably be based on protractor (new Angular testing framework).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Undefining/redefining components (for scale).  RequireJS has an undef function
that may enable this, but it may also be quite complicated.  This is pie-in-the-sky stuff
for now.</p>
</li>
</ul>
