<p>In a traditional AngularJS application, you define and configure all components
before the application runs.  The seperation between &quot;configuration time&quot; and
&quot;run time&quot;, along with the dependency injection system, enables the programmer
to define all components <em>in any order</em> and to know that they will all be
configured prior to any of them being run.  This might sound like a truism!</p>
<p>There may be application where defining and configuring every component that the
application will use is not optimal.  A few reasons to delay are:</p>
<ul>
<li>there are a very large number of components split up among many states</li>
<li>there are some very large individual components that are only needed for
certain routes/states within the application</li>
</ul>
<p>In these cases, one may want to delay loading components.  Couch Potato is
intended to make the above cases possible.</p>
<p>Additionally, you may have an application that, while developing it, you do
not know which components will ultimately be used.  For example, in a CMS
(Content Management System), it is conceivable that components that did not
even exist when the application was built are intended to be used within the
application.</p>
<p>In such a case, you most certainly need to delay loading the component!</p>
<p>Couch Potato is intended to be <em>part</em> of a solution for this type of loose
binding.</p>
<p><a href="#/guide/01.conceptual.how-it-works">How It Works</a> provides a relatively high-level explanation
of the methods that Couch Potato employs to allow for lazy loading and
registration of components.</p>
