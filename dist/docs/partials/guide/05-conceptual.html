<p>In a traditional AngularJS application, you define and configure all components
before the application runs.  The seperation between "configuration time" and
"run time", along with the dependency injection system, enables the programmer
to define all components <em>in any order</em> and to know that they will all be
configured prior to any of them being run.  This might sound like a truism!</p>

<p>There may be application where defining and configuring every component that the
application will use is not optimal.  A few reasons to delay are:</p>

<ul>
<li>there are a very large number of components split up among many states</li>
<li>there are some very large individual components that are only needed for
certain routes/states within the application</li>
</ul>

<p>In these cases, one may want to delay loading components.  Couch Potato is
intended to make the above cases possible.</p>

<p>Additionally, you may have an application that, while developing it, you do
not know which components will ultimately be used.  For example, in a CMS
(Content Management System), it is conceivable that components that did not
even exist when the application was built are intended to be used within the
application.</p>

<p>In such a case, you most certainly need to delay loading the component!</p>

<p>Couch Potato is intended to be <em>part</em> of a solution for this type of loose
binding.</p>

<p><a href="#/guide/01.conceptual.how-it-works">How It Works</a> provides a relatively high-level explanation
of the methods that Couch Potato employs to allow for lazy loading and
registration of components.</p></div>
