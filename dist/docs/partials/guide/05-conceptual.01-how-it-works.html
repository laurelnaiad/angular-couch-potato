<h5 id="couch-potato-how-it-works_in-general">In General</h5>
<p>Couch Potato works by preparing itself -- at configuration-time to do -- at
run-time -- the work of registering components.</p>
<p>In a normal AngularJS application, when run-time starts (which is typically
when module.run happens or when the application is bootstrapped), all providers
become &quot;uninjectable.&quot;  As such, you lose the ability to configure components.</p>
<p>By storing references to the key registration &quot;vehicles&quot;, Couch Potato can perform
registrations during run-time.  The components Couch Potato maintains references
to are:</p>
<ul>
<li>$controllerProvider,</li>
<li>$compileProvider,</li>
<li>$provide,</li>
<li>$filterProvider</li>
</ul>
<p>Lazy-registration would be of little use if you couldn&#39;t lazily <em>load</em> script.</p>
<p>This is where AMD (Asynchronous Module Definition) comes in.  Couch Potato uses <a href="requirejs.org" target="_blank">RequireJS</a>.  If you are unfamiliar with
RequireJS, you&#39;ll want to read up a little.  The general idea is that an AMD
module definition states a list of dependencies and then specifies its
definition.</p>
<p>When a module is requested (&quot;required&quot; in AMD terms), all of it dependencies
are fetched (or retrieved from the cache if they&#39;ve already been required), and
then passed to the module as function parameters.  Continue by reading about
<a href="#/guide/17-couch-potato-components">Couch Potato Components</a>.</p>
<p>This guide is about to get heavy.  If you haven&#39;t already done so, it&#39;s highly
recommended that you stop and <a href="samples">look at the samples</a>
before you proceed.</p>
