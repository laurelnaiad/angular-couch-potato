<p>The first sample is the "low end" of Couch Potato usage.  It totally
works but you leave some value on the table.  It's meant to shadow angular-seed
and to demonstrate the variety of components that *can* be lazy-loaded.  It does
not follow the recommended source code layout (semantic), instead it follows
the angular-seed layout (directories for controllers, partials, etc.).

If you're building a big
app -- which, of course, is one of the reasons to use Couch Potato -- then
you should consider following the techniques in the second sample.
